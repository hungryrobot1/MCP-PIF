# Development Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines patterns and practices for extending and modifying the MCP TypeScript server. It provides a collaborative learning path that supports progressive understanding of the system's architecture and implementation patterns.

## Getting Started

### First Steps
1. **Establish Context**
   - Review high-level architecture and goals
   - Understand core implementation patterns
   - Define specific extension or modification goals

2. **Initial Planning**
   - Clarify desired functionality
   - Identify relevant existing patterns
   - Map out implementation approach

### Development Patterns

The server's modular architecture supports multiple development approaches and collaboration styles. Common tasks include:

- Understanding TypeScript type definitions
- Identifying patterns across the codebase
- Making architectural decisions
- Ensuring alignment with project goals
- Testing and validation

## Adding New Modules

### Phase 1: Planning
1. Define module purpose and scope
2. Identify required tools
3. Plan data structures and interfaces

### Phase 2: Implementation
1. Create core module structure
2. Implement handler interfaces
3. Add business logic
4. Implement error handling
5. Write tests

### Example Structure

```typescript
// Handler implementation following standard patterns
export class NewModuleHandler implements MCPModuleHandler<NewModuleArgs> {
    name = 'newModule';
    private logger = new Logger('NewModule');

    tools: Tool[] = [/* Tool definitions */];

    async handle(toolName: string, args: unknown, context: WorkspaceContext): Promise<CallToolResult> {
        // Implementation details based on requirements
    }
}

// Core functionality separated from handler
interface NewModuleConfig {
    // Configuration options based on use case
}
```

## Core Patterns

### Module Structure
```
moduleDir/
├── module.ts         // Core functionality
└── moduleHandler.ts  // MCP interface implementation
```

Key considerations:
- Separation of concerns between files
- Interface consistency
- Error handling patterns
- State management
- Cross-module communication

## Problem Solving

When addressing issues:
1. Identify type mismatches or pattern violations
2. Consider edge cases and user impact
3. Design and implement solutions
4. Validate against existing patterns

## Best Practices

### Documentation
- Focus on clarity and completeness
- Document both concepts and implementation
- Include practical examples
- Maintain progressive disclosure pattern

### Testing
- Define comprehensive test scenarios
- Cover edge cases and error conditions
- Ensure type safety
- Test cross-module interactions

## Progressive Understanding

The development process follows natural layers of complexity:
1. Core concepts and patterns
2. Implementation details
3. Module-specific patterns
4. Advanced system features

## Next Steps

To begin development:
1. Choose an initial module or modification
2. Follow established patterns
3. Document insights and challenges
4. Iterate based on feedback

## Notes on Extension

The MCP TypeScript server is designed to evolve through use. When extending the system:
- Build on existing patterns
- Maintain type safety
- Consider cross-module impacts
- Document new patterns as they emerge

Remember: The goal is not just to add functionality, but to contribute to the system's evolution while maintaining its core principles of structured emergence and progressive understanding.
